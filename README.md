# Comprehensive NLP Web Application

Iâ€™m thrilled to announce the completion of my latest projectâ€”a comprehensive web application incorporating NLP functionalities, all built from scratch using PyTorch and Django!

## Project Highlights

ðŸŒŸ **Text Generation**: Leveraging a decoder-only architecture, this feature generates coherent and contextually relevant text, perfect for applications like story generation.

ðŸŒŸ **Image Caption Generation**: Utilizing a CNN + decoder-only transformers architecture, this model automatically generates descriptive captions for images.

ðŸŒŸ **Translation (English to French)**: Powered by an encoder-decoder architecture, this feature translates text from English to French with high accuracy, facilitating seamless communication across languages.

ðŸŒŸ **Sentiment Analysis**: Built on an encoder-only architecture, this tool analyzes text sentiment, providing valuable insights into customer feedback, social media monitoring, and more.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django for robust server-side logic and API management.
- **NLP Models**: Implemented from scratch using PyTorch, based on the Transformer architecture introduced in the groundbreaking "Attention Is All You Need" paper.

## Acknowledgements

This project wouldn't have been the same without the incredible support and contribution of Shivam Verma and Pradyumn Shirsath for frontend development. Thank you for being an essential part of this project.
